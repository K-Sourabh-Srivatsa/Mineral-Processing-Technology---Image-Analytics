# Mineral-Processing-Technology---Image-Analytics

## Software Requirements

- Python 3.11.6
- Python Libraries:
    1. Opencv-python (`pip install opencv-python`)
    2. Opencv-python-headless (`pip install opencv-python`)
    3. Numpy (`pip install numpy`)
    4. Pillow (`pip install Pillow`)

## Execution Process

### Method 1

1. Go to the code folder and then right-click on "main.py" and select "Copy as path".
2. Open the command prompt/terminal and execute the following command: `python "<insert_copied_path>"`
3. Wait for the process to complete and then check the output by following the section "Checking Output" mentioned below.

### Method 2

Using PyCharm IntelliJ IDEA Code Editor to execute:

1. Open the folder "code" using the PyCharm IDE.
2. Then open the file "main.py".
3. Ensure that the run/debug configuration is set as "main".
4. Now Run "main.py" with the above configuration.
5. Wait for the process to complete and then check the output by following the section "Checking Output" mentioned below.

**NOTE:** Ensure that you follow step 3 mandatorily.

## Checking Output

To check the output, navigate to the output folder, where you will discover five folders, namely:

1. Centroid
2. Major Axis
3. Perimeter
4. Smallest Circle
5. Total Surface Area.

If you wish to inspect specific results for an input image:

- For the centroid of input image 1 (img_1), go to the Centroid folder and open output_image 1.
- To examine the total surface area of input image 4, locate the Total Surface Area folder and open output_image 4.

Repeat the above pattern for any other output you want to check.
